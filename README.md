### Hi, my name is Christoffer 👋🏻

I'm a tech professional that loves innovation and technology. Most of the time you see me either writing code or planning some new feature. I'm a generalist when it comes to programming languages so I have worked with quite a few languages during my career. Currently my favorite language is TypeScript. I really enjoy to work with modern web technologies such as React and GraphQL.

I’m a big fan of video games and my favorite drink is coffee.
