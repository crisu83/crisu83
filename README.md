### Hi, my name is Christoffer 👋🏻

I am a technology professional with 15 years of experience in software development. One of my greatest passions is to create software that is easy to understand and maintain using modern technologies. I am a proponent of Clean Code, Domain-Driven Design, and Extreme Programming.

Over the past years, I thought myself different programming languages to broaden my understanding of programming. These languages include Go, Haskell, ReasonML, and Rust. I am a polyglot programmer who never wants to stop learning.

In my free time, I like to do sports, watch Netflix, or spend time with my loved ones. My favorite drink is coffee, but sometimes I also enjoy a glass of red wine.
