### Hi, my name is Christoffer 👋🏻

I am a seasoned technology professional with 15 years of hands-on expertise in software development. My greatest passion lies in writing code and crafting user-friendly software using modern technologies.

I primarily work with TypeScript, Kotlin, and Rust; however, I continuously strive to learn new programming languages to expand my knowledge. I am a proponent of best practices such as Clean Code, Domain-Driven Design, and Extreme Programming.

When not programming, I enjoy engaging in sports activities, unwinding with Netflix, and spending quality time with my family. While I prefer water as my go-to drink, I enjoy coffee in the morning and would not turn down a glass of good wine.
